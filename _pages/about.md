<h4><code> $ less About </code></h4>
Hi There! 🎉
My name is Dongming Liu, a Master of Science student studying in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) (UIUC). Currently, I am TAing [ECE 385: Digital Systems Laboratory](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/ece385).

<h4><code>$ cat Interest </code></h4>
I like computer architecture and embedded systems. Currently, I am investigating some interesting applications of CXL devices.

During my free time, I enjoy cooking, baking (a huge dessert fan), playing video games, and playing badminton.
