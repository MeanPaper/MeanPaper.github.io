<h4><code> $ less About </code></h4>
Hi There! ðŸŽ‰

I am Dongming Liu, a senior student majoring in Computer Engineering at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). I work as a class assistant in [ECE 391 Computer System Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/ece391). Currently, I am applying for a Master's degree in CompE or CompSci starting in Fall 2024.ðŸŽ“

<h4><code>$ cat Interest </code></h4>
I like computer systems and architecture, web development, and game development. Currently, I am investigating my interests in embedded systems and learning programming on Raspberry Pi and STM32.

What about research interests... Good question... I am still trying to find out.

Besides the interests above, I like cooking, playing video games, and playing badminton.
